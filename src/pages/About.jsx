        Hi! I'm a deeply passionate developer currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science at KIIT University.
        My primary interests lie in full-stack web development, particularly with React and Tailwind CSS.
        I'm also deeply engaged in <span className="font-medium">Machine Learning</span> and <span className="font-medium">Cybersecurity</span>,
        exploring ways to combine smart systems with secure and scalable applications.
        I love building dynamic and responsive interfaces, and Iâ€™m always open to learning and collaborating on exciting tech projects.
